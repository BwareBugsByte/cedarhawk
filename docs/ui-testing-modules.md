Design: UI Testing Modules
=====================
The UI Testing Modules are a core part of CedarHawk and are responsible for ensuring that the website's user interface behaves as expected. These modules work together to verify layout consistency, validate the presence and functionality of essential UI elements, and confirm that the site is responsive across various viewport sizes.
a. Layout Verification Module
Role

    DOM Extraction:
        Parse the HTML provided by the Crawler Module to build a representation of the pageâ€™s DOM. This includes identifying the container hierarchy and common elements such as headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.
    Layout Comparison:
        Compare the extracted DOM structure against expected layouts defined in the configuration file.
        Check for consistency across different pages and screen sizes.
        Identify any discrepancies in layout, such as missing or misaligned components.

Interactions

    Input:
        Receives HTML/DOM data from the Crawler Module.
        Uses configuration parameters (from the Configuration Loader) that specify expected layout patterns and key elements.
    Processing:
        Extracts and represents the layout in a structured format (e.g., tree or graph).
        Compares the layout structure across multiple pages and viewports.
    Output:
        Generates a JSON report highlighting any layout inconsistencies, discrepancies, or missing elements.

b. UI Elements Validation Module
Role

    Element Presence Check:
        Verify that essential UI components (buttons, links, images, text fields) are present on each page.
    Functionality Testing:
        Confirm that UI elements function as intended. For example, validate that clickable elements have the correct attributes (e.g., onclick handlers).
    Image Verification:
        Check that images load successfully by validating that image URLs return a proper response and are not broken.

Interactions

    Input:
        Processes HTML data provided by the Crawler Module.
        Utilizes validation rules defined in the configuration file for determining which elements are required and any specific attributes they must possess.
    Processing:
        Scans the DOM for required elements and inspects their attributes.
        Performs HTTP checks on image URLs to ensure they return valid responses.
    Output:
        Produces a detailed JSON report summarizing the status of each UI element, including any missing elements, malfunctioning components, or broken links.

c. Responsiveness Testing Module
Role

    Viewport Simulation:
        Simulate various viewport sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile) based on settings provided in the configuration file.
    Layout Adaptation:
        Verify that the UI adjusts appropriately to different viewport sizes. This includes checking that elements scale correctly, remain accessible, and that the overall layout does not break.
    Responsive Behavior Analysis:
        Evaluate how dynamic components behave under different viewport constraints.

Interactions

    Input:
        Receives viewport configuration settings from the Configuration Loader.
        Uses HTML/DOM data from the Crawler Module.
    Processing:
        For each defined viewport size, simulate the environment and analyze the DOM to detect any layout shifts or issues.
        Compare actual UI element positioning and scaling against expected outcomes.
    Output:
        Generates a JSON report that details the responsiveness test results for each viewport size, including any detected issues or layout breaks.
