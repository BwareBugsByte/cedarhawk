Design: Deployment and Maintenance Considerations
==========
# 1. Overview

CedarHawk is designed as a standalone command-line tool built in Go. This document outlines the strategies for deploying CedarHawk, distributing binaries, providing user documentation, and ensuring ease of future updates and modular additions. The aim is to achieve a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly product that can be updated with minimal disruption.

# 2. Deployment Strategy
Binary Distribution

    Static Binaries:
        Compile CedarHawk as static binaries using Go’s cross-compilation features. This enables distribution across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) without requiring users to install additional dependencies.
    Build Automation:
        Use Go’s built-in go build command in conjunction with Makefiles or shell scripts to automate building and packaging.
    Versioning:
        Follow semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) and tag releases in the repository. Include the version number in the binary output for easy identification.
    Distribution Channels:
        Publish releases on GitHub (or an equivalent platform) with pre-built binaries.
        Optionally, use package managers (like Homebrew for macOS or apt for Linux) if community adoption warrants it.

User Documentation

    Comprehensive README:
        Provide a detailed README that explains installation, configuration, and usage.
    Documentation Directory:
        Include a docs/ folder that covers:
            Detailed user guides.
            Configuration examples (config.toml sample).
            Troubleshooting and FAQ sections.
    In-Binary Help:
        Implement CLI flags (e.g., --help or -h) to display usage information and configuration options.
    Changelog and Roadmap:
        Maintain a changelog to inform users about new features, bug fixes, and improvements.
        Provide a roadmap for future enhancements to encourage community contributions.

# 3. Maintenance and Future Updates
Modular Design for Ease of Updates

    Separation of Concerns:
        Each component (crawler, UI tests, results generator, AI integration) resides in its own package, facilitating independent updates without affecting core functionality.
    Pluggable Interfaces:
        Interfaces (such as the AI Plugin Interface) allow for future enhancements without major refactoring.
    Extensible Configuration:
        Use a configuration file (config.toml) that can be easily extended to include new features and parameters.

Long-Term Support Considerations

    Version Control and CI/CD:
        Utilize version control best practices and integrate continuous integration (CI) pipelines to run automated tests on every commit.
    Community and Documentation:
        Encourage community contributions by providing clear coding guidelines and contribution instructions in the documentation.
    Bug Tracking and Issue Management:
        Use GitHub Issues or a similar tool to manage bugs and feature requests, ensuring that maintenance tasks are tracked and prioritized.
    Automated Testing:
        Maintain comprehensive unit, integration, and system tests (as detailed in the Testing and Verification Plan) to ensure stability with each update.
    Logging and Monitoring:
        Incorporate detailed logging (as defined in the Logging and Error Handling design) to help diagnose issues quickly in production environments.
