Design: AI Plugin Integration Interface
=====================
# 1. Overview

The AI Plugin Integration Interface is designed to provide a pluggable mechanism for integrating AI-driven validation in CedarHawk. Although the initial version of CedarHawk does not implement a full AI module, this interface will serve as a clear contract for future AI components. The interface will allow the system to invoke AI-based analysis of test results, while a stub implementation logs “AI plugin not implemented” without disrupting other tests.

---

# 2. Interface Definition
AIPlugin Interface

The AI plugin is defined as an interface that any future AI module must implement. The interface will include one or more methods that process or validate test results.

Below is a sample Go code snippet that outlines the interface:

// AIPlugin defines the interface that all AI modules must implement.
type AIPlugin interface {
    // AnalyzeResults processes the aggregated test results and returns an analysis report.
    AnalyzeResults(results TestResults) (AIAnalysisReport, error)
}

// TestResults represents the aggregated test output from all modules.
type TestResults struct {
    Page       string
    Layout     LayoutResult
    UIElements []UIElementResult
    Responsiveness []ResponsivenessResult
    // Additional fields as needed.
}

// AIAnalysisReport represents the output from the AI module.
type AIAnalysisReport struct {
    Summary    string
    Recommendations []string
}

Key Points:

    AnalyzeResults Method:
        Accepts a TestResults structure containing the consolidated results of all tests.
        Returns an AIAnalysisReport that includes a summary and any recommendations.
        Returns an error if the analysis cannot be performed.

    Extensibility:
        The interface is designed to be minimal to allow a range of AI techniques to be implemented in the future, from simple heuristics to advanced machine learning models.

# 3. Integration Strategy
Invocation during Tests

    Conditional Invocation:
        During the test execution phase, after aggregating the results from the crawler, UI tests, and responsiveness tests, the main entry point checks if an AI plugin is configured.
    Stub Functionality:
        If no AI module is provided, a default stub implementation will be used. This stub simply logs “AI plugin not implemented” and returns the original test results unmodified or with a placeholder report.
    Example Integration in Main Flow:

// aiPlugin is a variable of type AIPlugin that is set via configuration.
var aiPlugin AIPlugin = &DefaultAIPluginStub{}

// DefaultAIPluginStub is a stub implementation of the AIPlugin interface.
type DefaultAIPluginStub struct{}

// AnalyzeResults logs that the AI plugin is not implemented and returns a placeholder report.
func (stub *DefaultAIPluginStub) AnalyzeResults(results TestResults) (AIAnalysisReport, error) {
    log.Println("AI plugin not implemented")
    return AIAnalysisReport{
        Summary: "AI analysis not available.",
        Recommendations: []string{},
    }, nil
}

// In the main execution flow:
func processTestResults(results TestResults) {
    // Optionally call the AI plugin if one is configured.
    analysis, err := aiPlugin.AnalyzeResults(results)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Error during AI analysis: %v", err)
    } else {
        // Merge or log the analysis into the final JSON output.
        log.Printf("AI Analysis Summary: %s", analysis.Summary)
    }
}

Integration with the System

    Modular Placement:
        The AI plugin interface and default stub will reside in the internal/ai/ai.go file.
        This module will be imported and called by the Main Entry Point after all standard tests have completed.

    Configuration Driven:
        Future configurations may allow users to specify a custom AI plugin. For now, the default stub remains in effect.

    Non-Disruptive Behavior:
        The AI module is entirely optional; its failure or absence does not affect the execution of core test functions. Results from core modules are reported regardless of AI plugin status.

---

# 4. Stub Functionality Description

    Default Behavior:
        The default stub logs a message indicating the AI plugin is not implemented.
        It returns an AIAnalysisReport with a summary stating that AI analysis is not available.
    Non-Interference:
        The stub ensures that even if no AI module is provided, test execution and result aggregation continue without error.
    Future Replacement:
        Developers can replace the stub with a fully functional AI module that adheres to the AIPlugin interface without modifying the rest of the codebase.
