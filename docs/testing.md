Design: Testing and Verification Plan for CedarHawk
======================================
# 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategies and criteria for verifying each design component of CedarHawk once implemented. It covers unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The goal is to ensure that every module functions as expected, interacts correctly with other components, and meets defined performance and quality metrics.

---

# 2. Unit Testing Strategy
Configuration Loader

    Tests:
        Validate correct parsing of well-formed TOML configuration files.
        Verify that default values are applied when optional fields are missing.
        Test error handling for malformed or missing required fields (e.g., startURL).
    Criteria for Success:
        100% coverage of config parsing logic.
        Errors are correctly propagated and logged.
        Output configuration struct matches expected values.

Crawler Module

    Tests:
        Confirm that the crawler correctly marks URLs as visited to avoid loops.
        Test extraction of links from sample HTML strings.
        Validate HTTP fetching using simulated HTTP servers (via Go’s httptest package).
        Handle edge cases (invalid URLs, network failures).
    Criteria for Success:
        No duplicate URLs are processed.
        Recursive depth does not exceed the configured maximum.
        Error messages are returned for HTTP failures.

UI Testing Modules

    Layout Verification Module:
        Test that the DOM structure is correctly extracted and compared.
        Verify that layout discrepancies are identified.
    UI Elements Validation Module:
        Check detection of essential elements (buttons, links, images, text fields).
        Validate that HTTP requests to image URLs correctly detect broken links.
    Responsiveness Testing Module:
        Simulate multiple viewport sizes and verify that layout adjustments are detected.
    Criteria for Success (All UI Modules):
        Each module accurately identifies issues against known sample HTML.
        Modules return structured JSON output with clear pass/fail status and error details.

Results Generator

    Tests:
        Verify that test results from all modules are aggregated correctly.
        Validate that the final JSON output conforms to the predefined schema.
    Criteria for Success:
        Complete and correct JSON output that includes all test data and logged errors.

AI Plugin Interface (Stub)

    Tests:
        Confirm that the default stub logs “AI plugin not implemented.”
        Verify that the stub returns a placeholder report without affecting overall results.
    Criteria for Success:
        The stub’s behavior is consistent and non-disruptive to the testing workflow.

---

# 3. Integration Testing Strategy
Inter-Module Interaction

    Configuration Loader + Crawler:
        Test that crawler behavior (e.g., maximum depth, domain restrictions) is driven by configuration settings.
    Crawler + UI Testing Modules:
        Validate that HTML/DOM data from the crawler is correctly processed by each UI testing module.
    UI Modules + Results Generator:
        Ensure that individual module outputs are correctly aggregated into a unified JSON report.
    AI Plugin Integration:
        Verify that the main entry point correctly calls the AI plugin interface and integrates its output.

Test Cases:

    Valid Workflow:
        Provide a sample website (or mock HTTP server) and ensure that all modules work together end-to-end.
    Error Conditions:
        Simulate failures (e.g., unreachable URL, malformed HTML) and verify that errors propagate correctly.

Criteria for Success:

    All modules integrate seamlessly with minimal data loss or miscommunication.
    Errors from one module do not prevent other modules from completing their tasks.
    The final JSON result contains a consolidated view of both successes and errors.

---

# 4. System Testing Strategy
End-to-End Testing

    Scenario-Based Testing:
        Execute the entire tool using a controlled environment (e.g., a local test website with known issues).
        Verify that the complete process—from configuration loading to JSON result generation—runs smoothly.
    Performance Testing:
        Measure the tool’s performance on websites of varying sizes.
        Check for resource usage (memory, CPU) and response times.
    User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
        Validate that the tool meets user expectations regarding ease of use and clarity of output.

Criteria for Success:

    The tool completes an end-to-end run within acceptable time limits.
    Generated JSON reports are accurate, complete, and follow the defined schema.
    Performance metrics meet predefined benchmarks for response time and resource usage.

# 5. Metrics and Success Criteria for Each Module

    Configuration Loader:
        Metric: 100% parsing accuracy, proper error handling.
    Crawler Module:
        Metric: No duplicate URL processing; correct recursive depth; error rate below a specified threshold.
    UI Testing Modules:
        Metric: ≥95% accuracy in detecting UI elements, layout, and responsiveness issues against sample pages.
    Results Generator:
        Metric: JSON output conforms to schema with 100% aggregation of test data.
    AI Plugin Interface:
        Metric: Consistent logging of “AI plugin not implemented” and proper stub output.

# 6. Testing Tools and Frameworks

    Go’s Built-In testing Package:
        For unit tests and integration tests.
    httptest Package:
        To simulate HTTP responses for the crawler.
    Table-Driven Tests:
        For extensive test coverage across different inputs and scenarios.
    Logging and Coverage Tools:
        Built-in tools to monitor test coverage and log output for debugging.

# 7. Documentation and Reporting

    Test Case Documentation:
        Each test case will be documented with an ID, description, expected outcome, and criteria.
    Result Reporting:
        Test results will be logged in real-time and aggregated into JSON output.
        A summary report will be generated after each test run.
    Continuous Integration:
        Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to ensure regressions are caught early.

# 8. Conclusion

This testing and verification plan provides a structured approach to validate each component of CedarHawk. By defining clear unit, integration, and system testing strategies and establishing measurable success criteria, this plan guides the implementation phase and ensures a robust, reliable final product.
