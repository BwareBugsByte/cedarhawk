          [Optional AI Plugin Interface]

# Key Design Decisions, Assumptions, and Constraints

    Built-in Libraries Only:
        The design leverages only Goâ€™s built-in packages (e.g., net/http, encoding/json) to minimize external dependencies.
    Modularity:
        Each component is designed as an independent module, making it easy to test, maintain, and potentially replace.
    Configuration-Driven:
        The behavior of CedarHawk is governed by the user-provided config.toml, allowing flexible customization without code changes.
    Error Handling and Logging:
        Centralized logging and error handling are integrated across modules, ensuring that failures are captured and reported consistently.
    Future-Proofing with AI Plugin:
        The architecture reserves a clear interface for future AI enhancements without impacting the core functionalities.
