Design: Responsiveness Testing Module
===========================
# 1. Overview

The Responsiveness Testing Module is responsible for simulating various viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) based on configurable settings. Its primary goal is to ensure that the website's UI scales correctly and that the layout adapts without breaking when viewed on different devices. The module will perform checks on element positioning, scaling, and overall layout integrity, and then report any responsiveness issues via a JSON output.

# 2. Configurable Viewport Settings
Configuration Source:

    The module will obtain viewport configurations from the user-defined config.toml file via the Configuration Loader.

Sample Configuration Schema:

[ui]
viewports = [
    { name = "desktop", width = 1920, height = 1080 },
    { name = "tablet", width = 768, height = 1024 },
    { name = "mobile", width = 375, height = 667 }
]

Details:

    Name: Identifies the viewport type (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
    Width & Height: Define the resolution to simulate for testing layout adaptation.

# 3. Simulation of Viewport Sizes
Approach:

    Data Emulation:
    Since the module relies on HTML/DOM data provided by the Crawler Module (rather than an actual browser), it will use heuristics to simulate how the layout should adjust under different viewport sizes.

    Viewport Context Creation:
        For each viewport configuration, the module will adjust expected layout parameters such as container widths, element positions, and scaling factors.
        It may maintain a set of expected breakpoints or a reference layout model (as defined in the configuration or documentation) against which the actual layout is compared.

    Rendering Simulation:
        Using the parsed HTML, the module will compute or infer element dimensions and positions.
        It will compare these values with expected values for each viewport size.
        For instance, if an element is expected to be full-width on mobile but appears with fixed margins, it will be flagged.

---

# 4. Checking for Proper Scaling and Layout Adaptation
Validation Steps:

    Element Positioning and Dimensions:
        Evaluate whether container elements resize appropriately relative to the viewport width.
        Check if text and images maintain proportionate scaling.

    Layout Breakpoints:
        Identify key breakpoints (from the configuration or built-in defaults) and verify that the layout adapts by reorganizing elements (e.g., switching from a multi-column layout on desktop to a single column on mobile).

    Visual Integrity Checks:
        Verify that no essential UI elements are clipped, overlapped, or rendered off-screen.
        Confirm that navigation menus, buttons, and other interactive components remain accessible and functionally visible.

Error Detection:

    Scaling Issues:
        Flag when an element does not resize as expected based on its container or viewport settings.
    Layout Disruptions:
        Detect when elements are misaligned or when containers overflow their expected boundaries.
    Breakpoint Failures:
        Identify if a layout does not switch appropriately at defined breakpoints.

# 5. Reporting Responsiveness Issues
JSON Output Structure:

The module will generate a JSON report that includes detailed responsiveness testing results for each viewport. An example output might look like:

{
  "page": "https://example.com",
  "responsiveness": [
    {
      "viewport": "desktop",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080,
      "status": "pass",
      "issues": []
    },
    {
      "viewport": "tablet",
      "width": 768,
      "height": 1024,
      "status": "fail",
      "issues": [
        {
          "element": "div#main-content",
          "issue": "Element width does not adjust to container; expected flexible width."
        },
        {
          "element": "nav#primary",
          "issue": "Navigation menu overlaps with header at 768px width."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "viewport": "mobile",
      "width": 375,
      "height": 667,
      "status": "fail",
      "issues": [
        {
          "element": "img#banner",
          "issue": "Image scales improperly; appears cropped on mobile view."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Error Reporting Strategy:

    Status Flag:
        Each viewport test result includes a status ("pass" or "fail") based on the number of issues found.
    Detailed Issues Array:
        For each viewport where issues are detected, a list of issues is reported with details such as the affected element and a description of the issue.
    Consolidated Summary:
        The final report aggregates results across viewports to provide an overall responsiveness assessment.

# 6. Module Interface
Public Interface Functions:

    RunResponsivenessTests(htmlData, viewportConfigs):
        Input: Parsed HTML/DOM data and a list of viewport configurations.
        Output: A structured JSON object summarizing the responsiveness test results.
    simulateViewport(htmlData, viewportConfig):
        Input: HTML/DOM data and a single viewport configuration.
        Output: A set of computed metrics (element dimensions, positions, etc.) that are compared against expected values.

Integration with Other Modules:

    Input Dependency:
        Receives HTML/DOM data from the Crawler Module.
        Utilizes configuration settings from the Configuration Loader.
    Output Dependency:
        Sends its results to the Results Generator for final aggregation into the JSON results file.
        Logs any detected issues using the Logging Module.
